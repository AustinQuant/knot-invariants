# knot-invariants
An introduction to knot theory written for an undergraduate mathematics degree. Includes a library of painstakingly hand-drawn knot theory diagrams that somebody may find useful.

This is intended to serve as an introduction to the field that is accessible to undergraduate mathematics students. I think that this is a really interesting area to get involved in because of the relationship to topological quantum computing which has made some advancements recently:

One day I might find it interesting to come back to this and look at making  a python project which can learn representations of knots and classify them in some way.

Hope you find it interesting!
